## 1. Introduction
Virender Singh ("we," "our," or "us") operates the **Kitchen Scraps & Food Waste Quiz App** (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our App on Android, Windows Desktop, or the Web.

## 2. Information We Collect

We do not require you to create an account to use the App. However, we may collect personally identifiable information (PII) that you voluntarily provide to us when you:
*   Submit feedback or suggestions through the App's feedback form.

### C. Virtual Currency (Credits)
We track your acquisition and usage of in-app "Credits." This data is stored locally on your device (in early versions) and may be synchronized to cloud servers (Google Firestore) in later versions to preserve your progress.

## 3. Use of Your Information

*   Respond to your feedback and customer service requests.

## 4. Disclosure of Your Information
We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations:

*   **Third-Party Service Providers:** We share data with third parties that perform services for us, specifically:
    *   **Google AdMob:** To deliver rewarded video ads. AdMob may use your device ID and location to show relevant ads.
    *   **Google Firebase/Firestore:** To store game data, analyze user behavior (Analytics), and manage backend infrastructure.
*   **Legal Requirements:** If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

## 5. Third-Party Advertisements
We use third-party advertising companies (specifically Google AdMob) to serve ads when you visit the App. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites/apps in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
